## <ins> Description of the Task: </ins>

The task that was given was to create a quiz game without encountering any issues.  

## <ins> Description of the Page: </ins>

This page is constructed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user will be able to start the game to see the rules and then confirm again to start the game and the timer. If the user gets a question incorrect, they will lose 5 seconds from their remaining time. At the end of the quiz, the remaining time will be recorded as a score. This program is available for interested parties who would like to test their knowledge on front end development.
